    <div id="entryTitle">1st changelog entry: 2/28/23</div><div id="entryText"><small>bit of a small one today, just this page. planned to get this done earlier, stuff happens though. more is on the way, stay tuned. as always, if you'd like to reccomend something, you can by following the link <a href="./index.html"> on the main page.</a> some stuff i've got planned is a complete transfer to React or Angular (would require a few days of downtime) and a Chess game, with the aforementioned React stuff, so if you want to see that do let me know. one final note, i'm working on getting the flash version of plants vs zombies working, so expect that to be added next.</small></div>

    <div id="entryTitle">vercel's in beta! 3/17/23</div>
    <div id="entryText"><small>we're back. at least for the people who i share a school with. this vercel is located at <a href="https://site-git-main-ethanholt1.vercel.app/">this link </a>. things ARE broken. so please mind the gap and excuse our dust while i get stuff together. for now the only things that work are retro bowl, minecraft, and alien hominid. anything that was sourced from an external repository is broken and gone. that's funny, isn't it. also, on the bright side, i FINALLY have CI (continuous integration) up, which means no more spontaneous refreshes! also, reccomendations have been moved to Git. so you'll need a Git account. that's all, happy gaming!</small></div>
    <div id="entryTitle">fixed the <small>important</small>games!</div>
    <div id="entryText"><small>we're back, again. m64 and the dino game were fixed. runescape coming later. yippee.</small></div>
