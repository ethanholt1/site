version control is cool!


## this is why i hate Git

some of these directories aren't populated, something with git not staging externally copied folders. anyways these directories are marked with a symbolic link icon. if you'd like to deploy, these directories will need to be cloned from: <br>

/scape from [2003scape/rsc-client](https://github.com/2003scape/rsc-client) <br>
/games/sm64/M64js from [Browncha023/M64js](https://github.com/Browncha023/M64js) <br>
/games/dino from [wayou/t-rex-runner](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner) <br>

everything else should normally be in its place, with a few exceptions.
 p.s.: if you know about git PLEASE reach out and help me with this
